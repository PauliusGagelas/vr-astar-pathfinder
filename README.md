# vr-astar-pathfinder
Application in VR that contains a surface on which enemies can be spawned and walk on.
By using the HTC Vive controller, a new obstacle is placed on the place the laser pointer points when the trigger is pressed.
The agents travel from the start to the end by calculating the shortest path with the A* algorithm.
